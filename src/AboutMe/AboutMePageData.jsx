    title: "CHILDHOOD",
    content:
      "Growing up between the U.S. and India shaped my adaptability and deepened my appreciation for diverse cultures. Living in India for two years immersed me in a community-centered way of life, where traditions like langar reinforced values of service and humility. Returning to the U.S., I carried these principles with me, shaping how I approach learning and problem-solving. ‘Kirat Karo’ (honest work) and ‘Sewa’ (selfless service) became guiding forces in my life.",

    title: "GROWTH",
    content:
      "Computer Science became my canvas—a tool for bridging disciplines and driving impact. I developed an app to reduce social isolation among the elderly. At the Hussman Institute of Genomics, I created an Alzheimer’s prediction model, and at JHU’s Cardiovascular Research Lab, I'm working to streamline aortic diagnoses. These experiences deepened my understanding of technology’s real-world potential, fueling my drive to translate complex data into solutions that enhance healthcare and empower communities.",

    content:
      "With that being said, I hope my unique perspective can not only make technology more impactful and accessible but also enhance the way we integrate it into everyday life to improve health, connectivity, and overall well-being.",
